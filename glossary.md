# Proof-of-Game (PoG) — Glossary

This glossary defines core terms used throughout the Proof-of-Game (PoG)
protocol specifications and governance documents.

All terms are capitalized when used in their defined sense.

---

## Game

A formalized interactive system in which an Agent generates actions over time
under a fixed set of rules.

A Game defines the behavioral space but does not determine value or outcomes.

---

## Agent

Any entity capable of generating actions within a Game.

An Agent may be a human, AI system, script, or hybrid.
PoG makes no assumptions about agent identity or origin.

---

## Action

An abstract intent or operation performed by an Agent.

Actions are conceptual and are not transmitted directly through the protocol.

---

## Event

A serialized, observable representation of an Action used by the PoG protocol.

Events are the only inputs processed by the Uniqueness Engine.

---

## Behavior

A time-ordered sequence of Events generated by an Agent during a Session.

Behavior represents the observable process, not intent or outcome.

---

## Session

A bounded interaction interval between an Agent and a Game.

All Events within a Session share a common time origin and ordering context.

---

## Canonical Behavior

A deterministic, normalized representation of Behavior produced after
validation and canonicalization by the Uniqueness Engine.

Canonical Behavior is consensus-critical.

---

## Canonicalization

A deterministic process that transforms raw Events into Canonical Behavior.

Canonicalization includes ordering, filtering, and downsampling,
and MUST NOT include inference or interpolation.

---

## Uniqueness

A measure of behavioral novelty relative to the allowed behavior space.

Uniqueness is evaluated structurally, not statistically or probabilistically.

---

## Uniqueness Block

A discrete unit of behavioral novelty used to determine mint eligibility.

Uniqueness Blocks are produced by evaluation, not directly observed.

---

## Uniqueness Engine (UE)

An off-chain, consensus-critical component that:

- validates and canonicalizes Events
- evaluates behavioral uniqueness
- produces deterministic EvaluationResults
- issues Attestations

UE behavior MUST be fully deterministic.

---

## EvaluationResult

A deterministic output of UE evaluation for a given Canonical Behavior.

Identical Canonical Behavior MUST produce identical EvaluationResults.

---

## Attestation

A cryptographically signed container asserting a valid EvaluationResult.

Attestations are the sole source of truth for on-chain verification.

---

## Network Difficulty

A global threshold defining the minimum number of Uniqueness Blocks
required for mint eligibility.

Difficulty is external to behavior and fixed at evaluation time.

---

## Ruleset

A strict definition of evaluation rules applied by the Uniqueness Engine.

Rulesets define a consensus domain and MUST be explicitly identified.

---

## Consensus-Critical

A property of protocol components or rules whose divergence
would lead to inconsistent mint eligibility or verification outcomes.
