# Proof-of-Game Protocol (PoG) v1

**RFC-style Specification**

**Status:** Draft v1.0
**Category:** Standards Track
**Scope:** Behavioral consensus and mint eligibility
**Audience:** protocol designers, SDK developers, UE implementers, node/contract developers

---

## 1. Conventions and Terminology

### 1.1 Normative Language

The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **SHALL**, **SHOULD**, **MAY** in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

### 1.2 Normative vs Non-Normative Sections

* Sections explicitly marked **Normative** define consensus-critical rules.
* Explanatory text, examples, and intuition are **Non-Normative** unless stated otherwise.

---

## 2. Glossary

**Game**
A formalized interactive system in which an Agent generates actions over time under a fixed set of rules.

**Agent**
Any entity capable of generating actions within a Game, including humans, AI systems, scripts, or hybrids.

**Action**
An abstract intent or operation performed by an Agent. Actions are not transmitted directly.

**Event**
A serialized, observable representation of an Action used by the PoG protocol.

**Behavior**
A time-ordered sequence of Events generated by an Agent during a Session.

**Session**
A bounded interaction interval between an Agent and a Game.

**Canonical Behavior**
A deterministic, normalized representation of Behavior after validation and canonicalization.

**Uniqueness**
A measure of behavioral novelty relative to the allowed behavior space.

**Uniqueness Block**
A discrete unit of behavioral novelty used for mint eligibility.

**Uniqueness Engine (UE)**
A consensus-critical off-chain component that canonicalizes behavior, evaluates uniqueness, and produces attestations.

**EvaluationResult**
A deterministic, consensus-critical result of UE evaluation.

**Attestation**
A cryptographically signed container issued by UE nodes asserting a valid EvaluationResult.

## 3. Purpose and Design Goals

Proof-of-Game (PoG) is a protocol for proving **uniqueness of behavior**, not:

* elapsed time,
* performance or success,
* identity,
* computational work.

### 3.1 Design Goals

* Universality (genre-agnostic)
* Minimal sensor surface
* Off-chain computation, on-chain verification
* Full determinism and reproducibility
* Forward compatibility

### 3.2 Explicit Non-Goals

PoG v1 does **not**:

* prove that an Agent is human
* forbid automation or AI
* evaluate skill or effectiveness
* store behavioral data on-chain
* define tokenomics or incentives

---

## 4. Conceptual Model

```
Game = Agent × Time × Rules × Actions
```

PoG evaluates the **structure of the behavioral process**, not its outcome.
Time is an ordering axis, not a source of value.

---

## 5. Protocol Architecture

### 5.1 Components

1. **SDK / Client**

   * Captures raw events
   * Encodes them in binary format
   * Assigns monotonic sequence numbers

2. **Gateway**

   * Receives event streams
   * MAY apply rate limits
   * MUST NOT perform canonicalization

3. **Uniqueness Engine (UE)** — **Normative**

   * Validates events
   * Applies canonicalization
   * Computes EvaluationResult
   * Issues Attestations

4. **Blockchain Layer**

   * Verifies Attestations
   * Executes mint logic
   * Stores final proofs

---

## 6. Session Model (Normative)

### 6.1 Lifecycle

1. Session starts at `ct = 0`
2. Agent emits ordered Events
3. Session ends explicitly or by timeout
4. UE computes canonical behavior and evaluation

### 6.2 Session Identity

Each session is uniquely identified by its **canonicalSessionRoot**.

---

## 7. Event Model (Normative)

### 7.1 Event Structure

Each Event is defined as:

```
e = (TYPE, EV, payload)
```

### 7.2 Binary Transport Encoding

```
TYPE (1 byte) | EV (1 byte) | PAYLOAD (variable)
```

* Endianness: Little-Endian
* Transport-agnostic

### 7.3 Mandatory Fields (v1)

All PoG v1 events MUST include:

```text
ct   : uint32   // milliseconds since session start
seq  : uint32   // monotonically increasing, starts from 0
```

---

## 8. Event Types (PoG v1)

### 8.1 mouse_move (absolute)

**TYPE:** `0x01`
**EV:** `0x01`

Payload:

```text
x   : uint16   // normalized [0..1]
y   : uint16   // normalized [0..1]
ct  : uint32
seq : uint32
```

Delta-encoded variants are **explicitly out of scope for PoG v1**.

---

## 9. Invalid Event Handling (Normative)

UE MUST apply **soft rejection**.

An Event MUST be **dropped** if any of the following holds:

* `seq` does not start from 0 (all events before first `seq=0` are dropped)
* `seq` is not strictly increasing
* `ct` is invalid or non-monotonic
* `x` or `y` ∉ `[0,1]`
* payload length mismatches specification
* `TYPE` or `EV` is unknown

Dropped events:

* MUST NOT participate in canonicalization
* MUST NOT affect sessionRoot or uniqueness

UE MUST NOT repair, interpolate, or infer events.

---

## 10. Canonicalization (Normative)

Canonicalization is **consensus-critical** and MUST be performed by UE.

### 10.1 Canonical Steps (in order)

1. **Stable time ordering**

   * Sort by `ct` ascending
   * If equal `ct`, sort by `seq`

2. **Exact duplicate removal**

   * Bitwise-identical decoded events are removed

3. **Downsampling**

   * Canonical rate: **25 Hz**
   * Frame interval: **40 ms**
   * `frameIndex = floor(ct / 40)`
   * **Last-in-frame** selection

No interpolation, spatial quantization, or gap synthesis is permitted.

---

## 11. Minimum Session Viability (Normative)

A session is eligible for evaluation only if:

```text
canonicalFrameCount ≥ 500
```

At 25 Hz this corresponds to **20 seconds** of canonical behavior.

UE MUST NOT produce EvaluationResult or Attestation below this threshold.

---

## 12. Evaluation Result (Normative)

### 12.1 EvaluationResult Object

```text
EvaluationResult {
  canonicalSessionRoot
  uniqueBlocks
  rulesetId
  protocolVersion
  uniquenessScore   // optional, non-normative
}
```

### 12.2 Determinism Guarantee

For identical canonical behavior `B_s`:

```
EvaluationResult(B_s) MUST be identical bit-for-bit
```

Any UE implementation violating this is **non-compliant**.

---

## 13. Network Difficulty (Normative)

Mint eligibility requires:

```
uniqueBlocks ≥ NetworkDifficulty
```

* Difficulty is global
* Fixed at pre-mint
* Included in Attestation metadata

---

## 14. Attestation Model (Normative)

### 14.1 Attestation Object

```text
Attestation {
  evaluationResult
  networkDifficulty
  expiry
  nonce
  protocolVersion
  signatures[]   // quorum signed
}
```

### 14.2 Properties

* Single-use
* TTL recommended: 6 hours
* Quorum-signed (N-of-M UE nodes)

---

## 15. On-Chain Verification (Normative)

The smart contract:

MUST:

* verify Attestation signatures and quorum
* verify TTL and single-use
* verify `uniqueBlocks ≥ NetworkDifficulty`
* verify protocol version compatibility

MUST NOT:

* recompute behavior
* process raw events
* reinterpret EvaluationResult

**The Attestation object is the sole source of truth on-chain.**

---

## 16. Threat Model and Security Considerations

### 16.1 Guarantees

PoG v1 guarantees:

* behavior occurred within a single session
* deterministic canonicalization
* mint eligibility based solely on uniqueness
* identical behavior ⇒ identical result
* on-chain consensus relies only on Attestation

### 16.2 Non-Guarantees

PoG v1 does not guarantee:

* human origin
* absence of AI or automation
* global agent uniqueness
* behavioral fairness or usefulness
* resistance to UE node collusion (requires decentralization)

---

## 17. Forward Compatibility

* New event types MAY be added under new `EV` values
* Unknown events MUST be dropped in v1
* `rulesetId` defines a strict consensus domain
* Future versions MUST NOT alter v1 semantics

---

## 18. Summary

Proof-of-Game v1 defines a **consensus-grade protocol** for proving behavioral uniqueness.

> **PoG proves not outcome, not time, and not identity —
> but the uniqueness of a behavioral process.**
