# Proof-of-Game (PoG)

Proof-of-Game (PoG) is a consensus protocol for proving the **uniqueness of behavioral processes**.

PoG does not measure time, performance, identity, or computational work.
It evaluates the structural uniqueness of behavior generated by an agent within a formalized game environment.

This repository contains the **canonical RFC-style specifications** of the PoG protocol.

## Shared Context and Governance

This repository uses shared organizational context and governance rules
provided by the Patternity meta repository.

The following documents are authoritative and MUST be consulted
before making changes or architectural decisions:

- `.meta/AI_GUIDE.md` — AI usage rules and constraints
- `.meta/CONTEXT.md` — organizational and project context
- `.meta/STYLE.md` — documentation and terminology standards
- `.meta/VERSIONING.md` — versioning and immutability rules

These documents take precedence over informal discussion or chat history.

## Status

- **Protocol:** Proof-of-Game (PoG)
- **Current Version:** v1
- **Status:** Draft (consensus-complete)
- **Category:** Standards Track

---

## Scope

This repository contains **no implementation code**.

It includes:
- protocol specifications
- RFC-style documents
- governance and security notes

Out of scope:
- SDKs
- Uniqueness Engine (UE) implementations
- smart contracts
- tokenomics or incentives

- **UE (Uniqueness Engine):** off-chain, consensus-critical component that canonicalizes behavior and issues attestations.

## Documents

- **RFC**
  - `RFC/pog-v1.md`

- **Specification**
  - `specs/v1/pog-v1.md`

- [Whitepaper](./WHITEPAPER.md) — motivation and design rationale (non-normative)
---

## Design Principles

- Deterministic canonicalization
- Minimal sensor surface
- Off-chain computation, on-chain verification
- Behavioral uniqueness as the sole source of value
- Forward compatibility

---

## Whitepaper

A non-normative whitepaper explaining the motivation, design philosophy,
and security assumptions behind Proof-of-Game:

- **[Proof-of-Game Whitepaper](./WHITEPAPER.md)**

The whitepaper is explanatory only and does not define protocol semantics.
