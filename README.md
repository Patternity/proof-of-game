# Proof-of-Game (PoG)

Proof-of-Game (PoG) is a consensus protocol for proving the **uniqueness of behavioral processes**.

PoG does not measure time, performance, identity, or computational work.
It evaluates the structural uniqueness of behavior generated by an agent within a formalized game environment.

This repository contains the **canonical RFC-style specifications** of the PoG protocol.
