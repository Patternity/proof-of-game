# AI Assistant Entry Point

This repository is part of the **Patternity** organization.

Before making any suggestions, changes, or explanations,
AI assistants MUST review the shared organizational context
and governance rules provided via the Patternity meta repository.

---

## Mandatory Context

Shared context and AI usage rules are located in:

```

.meta/AI_GUIDE.md
.meta/CONTEXT.md

```

These documents define:
- project-wide principles
- immutability and versioning rules
- documentation and terminology standards

They take precedence over chat history or inferred intent.

## Repository-Specific Notes

- Do not modify released protocol semantics.
- When in doubt, ask for clarification rather than guessing.

---

## Scope Reminder

This repository MAY contain:
- specifications
- documentation
- reference implementations

It MAY NOT contain:

- undocumented assumptions
- marketing or promotional claims
